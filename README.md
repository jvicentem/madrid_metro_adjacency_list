# madrid_metro_adjacency_list
The purpose of this project is to generate an adjacency list from the metro system serving the city of Madrid, capital of Spain. 

Have in mind that the travel time between Colombia and Nuevos Ministerios has been manually set as an NA because the time the Web site shows isn't valid (no direct connection between this two stations because Line 8 is closed).

There are other NAs too because, as mentioned before, Line 8 is closed. We must wait some months until we can know some travel times.

In the following weeks I'll try to get some value from the data.

Stay tuned!
