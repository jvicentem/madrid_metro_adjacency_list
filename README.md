# madrid_metro_adjacency_list
The purpose of this project is to generate an adjacency list from the metro system serving the city of Madrid, capital of Spain. 

Version with line colors and names plus travel time between stations: https://github.com/jvicentem/madrid_metro_adjacency_list/releases/tag/v3.2.1

Simple version (only vertices): https://github.com/jvicentem/madrid_metro_adjacency_list/releases/tag/v1.0.0

In the following weeks I'll try to get some value from the data.

Stay tuned!
